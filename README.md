I led a comprehensive systems analysis and design project to develop a solution for converting city light poles into electric vehicle charging stations. This involved meticulous planning, including defining project scope, objectives, and constraints. I employed project management best practices, such as creating a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) and utilizing Gantt charts for effective time management.

To ensure the project's success, I developed a comprehensive project proposal, outlining cost estimates, risk assessments, and detailed requirements Anales, Developed Use case. Performed Bugeting. I also designed various data models and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to lay the foundation for an app that would facilitate EV charging transactions. By effectively combining technical expertise and project management skills, I successfully delivered a robust project plan.
